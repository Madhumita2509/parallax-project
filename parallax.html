<p>Some of the largest mountain ranges that are present on the planet are fold mountains. The process of their
 formation is the most common one, which also ends up causing their height to increase over time. The tectonic
  plates of the Earth are always moving around without our knowledge. Whenever these plates collide head-on,
   their combined force pushes the landmass tremendously, causing them to rise on both ends and form towering 
   structures. The Himalayas, Andes, Alps, and many others are stunning examples of how massive fold mountains 
   can turn out to be, and how powerful the tectonic forces of the Earth generally are.

<p class="div">Andaman and Nicobar was occupied by Japan for 3 years during WWII. The takeover came as a result of Indian 
revolutionaries joining hands with the British’s enemies to create a stronghold. The Japanese landed at South Andaman on 23 March 1942.
 They soon took over the islands and freed the cellular jails inmates who were asked to join the Indian National Army. Most of them joined too.
  Eventually, the revolutionaries, headed by Dr. Subash Chandra Bose, convinced the Japanese to give the islands back to India.</p><p class="vid"> They then hoisted 
  the Indian flag here on 30 December 1943 and named the islands Shaeed Swaraj. But all did not remain well. The atrocities of the Japanese on the
   Indians was nothing short of the atrocities that happened during holocaust, but they aren’t spoken about as much. Over 2000
 Indians died during this period before the British recaptured the islands in 1945. It is rumoured that the Japanese made a secret
  tunnel connecting Ross Island to Port Blair. It is yet to be discovered.

<p>The Himalayas are the result of tectonic plate motions that collided India into Tibet.
Because of the great amount of tectonic motion still occurring at the site, the Himalayas have a proportionally high number of earthquakes and tremors.
The Himalayas are one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet.
The range affects air and water circulation systems, impacting the weather conditions in the region.
The Himalayas cover approximately 75% of Nepal.
Serving as a natural barrier for tens of thousands of years, the range prevented early interactions between the people of India and the people of China and Mongolia.
Mt. Everest was named after Colonel Sir George Everest, a British surveyor who was based in India during the early-to-mid-nineteenth century.
The Nepalese call Mt. Everest “Samgarmatha” which can be translated as “Goddess of the Universe” or “Forehead of the Sky.”
In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay were the first people to successfully climb to the summit of Everest.
Despite its name, the Snow Leopard – a Himalayan local – is actually most closely related to the Tiger.</p>
